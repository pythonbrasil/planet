Feature Goals for Planet 1.0
============================

  * Store and use feed history

    We have a huge problem at the moment, in that we only display the current
    contents of the feeds we download. The old Netscape standard was 15 items
    in a feed, so many people still use that. Unfortunately, on sites like
    Slashdot, those 15 items move *very* quickly. So as they fall off the feed,
    they fall off your Planet aggregate. That is bad, bad, bad, and we need to
    solve it. Any ideas? There are potential bugs all over this. :-)

  * Add multiple keyword support

    I hadn't announced it yet, but I have added a simple 'keyword feeds'
    feature, which allows you to subscribe to feeds and only display items that
    mention your keyword in the title, summary or description. This is totally
    arse-kickingly rad, and demonstrated on my personal Planet.
    
    However, currently it only allows you to define one keyword phrase for each
    feed, which kinda sucks. If there's some quick-and-dirty boolean phrase
    parser, we could use it really well here, for instance:

      keyword = (gnome OR kde) NOT sucks

    Maybe that's overkill - we could just support multiple ORed keyword fields.

  * Fix stupid UTF-8 error with current keyword support

    For some reason, keyword support tweaks string encoding errors, such as:
    "WARNING:root:Item wasn't in UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1, replaced all non-ASCII
    characters." This is bad.

  * Allow templates to use extra feed elements

    See Frederic's thread about Freshmeat the other day. I don't want to
    special case everything, and I don't want to stomp on item variables we
    already have, but it would be nice to bring special things from feeds up
    into the template data structure. Should we only do this for namespaced
    elements (extensions)?

  * Fix intermittent timezone detection / arithmetic bugs

    From Nick Moffitt: "Right now there's something screwy in the way planet
    deals with time zones, so that all you Australians end up claiming the top
    of my planet while merkins I want to read end up shoved down a ways."

  * Allow display normalisation to specified timezone

    Some Planet admins would like their feed to be displayed in the local
    timezone, instead of UTC.

  * Add "sort by entry received date" option

    From Nick Moffitt: "Is there a way to get planet to not do entry-date
    placement at all?  Like, always put new entries up in the order they were
    first seen by planet?  I use mine to implement the "show me stuff I haven't
    already read yet" feature that pretty much all Web sites lack.

    Answer from Scott J. Remnant: "Yeah, this would be actually pretty easy ...
    it already has this code for entries missing times entirely, I'll add a
    config option to just outright ignore feed times and sort by seen order.
    I'll make it a per-feed option, maybe "sort_order = seen/time" and if you
    want it global just stick it in [DEFAULT]."

  * Support OPML and foaf subscriptions

    This might be a bit invasive, but I want to be able to subscribe to OPML
    and FOAF files, and see each feed as if it were subscribed individually.
    Perhaps we can do this with a two-pass configuration scheme, first to pull
    the static configs, second to go fetch and generate the dynamic configs.
    The more I think about it, the less invasive it sounds. Hmm.

  * Provide a 'disabled' configuration option

    Make it easy to mark a feed as disabled, but still show it on the subs
    list. Perhaps disabled is the wrong word. Some people want to use Planet to
    do their blogroll management, but not actually show some feeds in the
    aggregation. If someone can think of a better word, please tell me.
    Perhaps 'hide'.

Other Feature Goals
